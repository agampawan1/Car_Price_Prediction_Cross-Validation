# Car_Price_Prediction_Cross-Validation
Prediction of Pricing dynamics of a new market.
In this Project We analyse the Factors, upon which the Prediction of Car Price has to done while Using Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning.

# Business Goal
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.So that they can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
